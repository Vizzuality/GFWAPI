## Estructure
### Routes Folder
This folder contain the distinct files that define the routes of the microservice. All files must be end with suffix Router. Ex:

```bash
/routes
------ /api
---------- userRouter.js // in this file define /user

The complete path is: /api/user
```

The name of subfolders of the routes folder define the subpath of the endpoints
